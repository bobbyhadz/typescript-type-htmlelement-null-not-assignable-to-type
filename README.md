## Instructions

The HTML code is in the `index.html` file.

The TypeScript code is in the `src/index.ts` file.

To be able to run the code, follow these instructions:

1. Clone the GitHub repository with the `git clone` command.
2. Open your terminal in the project's root directory (right next
   to `package.json`).
3. Install the node modules.

```bash:shell
npm install
```

4. To run the code, issue the `npm start` command.

```bash:shell
npm start
```

If you just want to build the project, issue the `npm run build`
command.

```bash:shell
npm run build
```

The command will output your JavaScript files into the `dist`
directory.
